Sentimental Analysis and Topic Modeling on Twitter data

I performed sentiment analysis and topic modeling for the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. I extracted approximately 50,000 tweets containing the hashtag #ukrainerussiawar from Twitter.

Using the generated data, I was able to determine the polarity and subjectivity of each tweet. Polarity is the intensity of an opinion, which may be positive or negative. Subjectivity is the degree to which an individual is personally invested in a topic, and it can be positive or negative as shown in in images attached below

I also performed Topic modeling on the data . Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can scan a collection of documents, detect word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically cluster word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a collection of documents.

I performed the modeling with the LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) model and then visualized the output with PylDavis(images attached). The model generated a cluster for 5 distinct topics that exemplified the various perspectives and emotions regarding the war. Some of the topics included:

Destruction of lives and property

History - which focuses on the war's origins and the rest on NATO.

Help - People pleaded for assistance and countrymen pleaded for evacuation.

Inflation - It was evident that the inflation rate had increased in Russia and Ukraine, affecting their citizens.

Sentimental Analysis and Topic modelling can also be applied by brands and companies to understand how customers are interacting or feeling about their product or service.
